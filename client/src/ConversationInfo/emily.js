      "Let’s start with a brief overview of 529 plans. They are tax-advantaged savings plans designed for education expenses. There are two main types: the 529 College Savings Plan and the 529 Prepaid Tuition Plan. The College Savings Plan allows you to invest in portfolios that may include both stocks and bonds, which we’ll go into more detail about. Prepaid Tuition Plans allow you to lock in tuition at today’s rates.",

      "For the 529 College Savings Plan, you can contribute up to $17,000 per year per child without triggering federal gift tax. However, there’s a special 5-year rule, allowing you to contribute up to $85,000 at once and spread it over five years for gift tax purposes.",

  //   timestamp: "0:12 - 0:13",
  //   speaker: "Financial Advisor",
  //   content:
  //     "Yes, a $50,000 initial contribution is a solid start. As for investment options, the funds will grow tax-free, and withdrawals are tax-free as long as they are used for qualified education expenses. If you were to invest $50,000 today in an aggressive growth fund with an average annual return of 7%, the account could grow to approximately $100,000 in 10 years.",

  //   speaker: "Financial Advisor",
  //   content:
  //     "With a bond fund, you might see a lower annual return, around 3-4%. So with a $50,000 contribution, after 10 years, the account could grow to around $70,000. Of course, it’s important to balance risk with your goals and timeline.",

For international schools, you can still use 529 plans, but the school must be accredited and eligible under U.S. Department of Education guidelines. I’d recommend checking if the school qualifies.",

  //   speaker: "Financial Advisor",
  //   content:
  //     "To manage volatility, you can choose an age-based portfolio. These portfolios start with a higher stock allocation when your children are young, gradually shifting towards bonds or more conservative investments as they approach college age. This helps balance growth potential and risk. Additionally, reviewing your portfolio annually, especially if you’ve invested $50,000 or more, is essential to keep it aligned with your risk tolerance.",

  //   speaker: "Financial Advisor",
  //   content:
  //     "You’re allowed to change the investment strategy twice per year. So if you see significant market shifts, you can adjust accordingly. However, an age-based portfolio reduces the need for constant management by automatically adjusting based on your child’s age.",

So while $50,000 might cover a significant portion of tuition today, in 10-15 years, you could be looking at a total cost of $150,000 or more per child. To bridge that gap, continued contributions over time, along with investment growth, can help. Based on your children’s ages, you may want to adjust the amount you save each year to meet this goal.",

Afterward, you can decide how much to contribute—whether that’s $50,000 upfront or smaller amounts each year. I’ll email you a summary of our discussion and help you compare specific 529 plans to find the best fit.",
